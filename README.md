# _**Super Mario Land HI-RES**_ by Manukura Games

## Idea

The purpose of this project is to reproduce _Super Mario Land_ for the _Nintendo Game Boy_ in Hi-res. The goal is to make the game look as close as possible to the original, all the while improving on the visuals and gameplay.

The game itself will be remade using Godot Engine, a free and open source game engine. The aim of this project is to familiarise myself with Godot 4. The game will be released under the MIT license.

## Progress

- Mario movement is accurate
- World 1-1 is mostly done
- Blocks can be hit

## To-do

- Mario's hitbox for hitting blocks form below needs to be taller while still being able to go through blocks from the side
