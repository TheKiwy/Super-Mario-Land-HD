# _**Super Mario Land HD**_ by Manukura Games

## Idea

The purpose of this project is to reproduce _Super Mario Land_ for the _Nintendo Game Boy_ in HD. The goal is to make the game look as close as possible to the original, all the while improving on the visuals and gameplay.

The game itself will be remade using Godot Engine, a free and open source game engine. The aim of this project is to familiarise myself with Godot 4. The game will be released under the MIT license.

I will also be filming the process of making the game, and will be uploading the videos to YouTube. The videos will be available in English and French.

## Progress

-   [ ] 1. Base mechanics: Tilemap, Player, Goomba
-   [ ] 2. Complete level 1-1
